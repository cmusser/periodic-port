periodic program executes one or more commands at regular intervals.
The commands run asynchronously with respect to their timer, which
means that an already-invoked process won't prevent the next
invocation from starting on the desired interval. Limits on the number
of concurrently-running copies of a process are enforced. periodic is
a lightweight alternative to cron and supports intervals down to one
second.
